PR Marketing Company - Database Management System (DBMS) Project

The PR Marketing Company DBMS project demonstrates the development and implementation of a sophisticated Database Management System (DBMS) for a leading PR marketing company. This project aims to revolutionize client relationship management, media contact tracking, and campaign data handling. It includes the conceptual model, logical model, data dictionary, and physical design of the database, alongside descriptions of expected tasks and related SQL queries.

Features:

Client Relationship Management: Efficiently manage client information and interactions.
Media Contact Tracking: Keep track of media contacts and their details.
Campaign Data Handling: Manage and analyze data related to various PR campaigns.
Conceptual Model: High-level representation of the database structure.
Logical Model: Detailed, technology-independent specification of the database.
Data Dictionary: Comprehensive list of all data elements, their descriptions, and attributes.
Physical Design and queries: Technology-specific implementation of the database using Oracle SQL Developer.

Project Components:

1. Conceptual Model
The conceptual model represents the high-level structure of the database, identifying the main entities such as Clients, Media Contacts, and Campaigns, and their relationships.

2. Logical Model
The logical model provides a detailed and normalized structure of the database, including tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. Example entities include Clients, MediaContacts, Campaigns, and CampaignResults.

3. Data Dictionary
The data dictionary describes all data elements in the database, including data types, constraints, and descriptions for each attribute. For example, the Clients table may include attributes like ClientID, ClientName, ContactInfo, and Industry.

4. Physical Design
The physical design implements the logical model in Oracle SQL Developer, including SQL scripts for creating tables, indexes, and relationships. For example, the Clients table could be created with SQL statements defining its structure and constraints.

Expected Tasks and Queries

Inserting New Client Information
A typical task may involve inserting new client information into the Clients table.

Tracking Media Contacts for a Specific Campaign
Another task could involve tracking media contacts associated with a particular campaign by joining relevant tables.

Analyzing Campaign Performance
Analyzing campaign performance might include queries to count results per campaign and summarize performance metrics.

Results:

This strategic investment underscores the company's commitment to innovation and excellence, enhancing efficiency and driving success in the PR marketing sector. The DBMS enables seamless management of client relationships, media contacts, and campaign data, thereby providing a robust foundation for data-driven decision-making.
